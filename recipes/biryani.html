    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically reserved for special occasions such as
    weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. For
    biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegitable oil</li>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Basmati Rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the meat : Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few
        minutes to reduce the gravy.</li>
        <li>Cook the Rice : Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices.</li>
        <li>Add the Chicken : Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Bake the Biryani : Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring.</li>
    </ol>
